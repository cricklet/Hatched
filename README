haven't yet refactored loading shaders

return by value copies the struct/whatever...
stuff in lambda cannot change object outside
lambda is essentially a struct

*always* use unique_ptr or shared_ptr OR allocate on stack.
disable copying on any gl related class
disable copying on anything that has a destructor
